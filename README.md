# BOOPTHAT
Files and instructions needed to build the BOOPTHAT (Batch Operating Optically Powered Targeted Heater for Activating Transgenes) setup

STEP files are currently available and f3d files will be available after they have been cleaned up slightly. Step by step instructions for assembling the micromanipulator cassettes, putting together the setup, and using the probes on embryos will be uploaded eventually.
